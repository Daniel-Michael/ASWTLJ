    <p class="important">Warning: nothing but motorcycles ahead:</p>

    <p>I think it's fair to say I love riding motorcycles, it's that simple. I have done since I was about four years old when my Dad bought me a PeeWee 80, a small CC automatic clutch motorcycle to learn on.</p>

    <blockquote>To me, riding motorcycles has become something of a way of life, I prefer to ride over driving a car in any situation, and I like short rides to the shops as well as long haul rides across country, or overseas.</blockquote>

    <p>I also like web design and development and have run a couple of different motorcycle focussed websites over the years, starting with <a href="https://www.ducatiblog.com.au" target="_blank">Ducati Blog</a>, then <a href="https://www.dailybikers.com" target="_blank">Daily Bikers</a> and most recently a more community focussed site where you can upload your own images and start a profile, talk with others etc. called <a href="https://www.motohoncho.com" target="_blank">Moto Honcho</a>.</p>

    <p>I guess you could call it something of an obsession.</p>

    <p>Some of the bikes I've had over the years include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>KTM 300</li>
        <li>Honda Grom MSX 125</li>
        <li>Suzuki DRZ 400e</li>
        <li>Buell XB12X</li>
        <li>BMW S1000R</li>
        <li>Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled</li>
        <li>BMW R1200GS</li>
  
    </ol>
    
    <h2 id="orange">KTM's are always orange</h2> 
    <h2 class="typewriter">Ducatis are always red</h2>

    <p class="typewriter">BMWs remind me of the colour blue.</p>

    <h2 class="emphasiss">I own a <span class="blue-highlight">BMW</span> and a <span class="red-highlight">Ducati</span>.</h2>

    <p class="indent">It doesn't really  matter <i>what</i> bike you ride, as long as you <b>ride</b> a bike, we can be <span class="emphasis">mates</span>.</p>

    <p class="more-readable">This text should have different spacing of all kinds. Including a different line height, word spacing and letter spacing.</p>

    <p class="offset">Something I enjoy is riding different styles of motorcycles, from racers to scramblers, adventure bikes to mini bikes, I like riding them all!</p>
