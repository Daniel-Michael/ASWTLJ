    <p>That's my name. And I love riding motorcycles, it's that simple. I have done sinece I was about four years old and my Dad bought me a PeeWee 80, a small CC automatic clutch motorcycle for learning on.</p>

    <blockquote>To me, riding motorcycles has become something of a way of life, I prefer to ride over driving a car in any situation, and I like short rides to the shops as well as long haul rides across country, or overseas.</blockquote>

    <p>I also like web design and development and have run a couple of different motorcycle focussed websites over the years, starting with <a href="https://www.ducatiblog.com.au" target="_blank">Ducati Blog</a>, then <a href="https://www.dailybikers.com">Daily Bikers</a> and most recently a more community focussed site where you can upload your own images and start a profile, talk with others etc. called <a href="https://www.motohoncho.com">Moto Honcho</a>.</p>

    <p class="indent">It doesn't really  matter <i>what</i> bike you ride, as long as you <b>ride</b> a bike, we can be <span class="emphasis">mates</span>.</p>

    <p class="more-readable">This text should have different spacing of all kinds. Including a different line height, word spacing and letter spacing.</p>

    <p class="offset">Something I enjoy is riding different styles of motorcycles, from racers to scramblers, adventure bikes to mini bikes, I like riding them all!</p>
